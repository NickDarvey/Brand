# Pride in craftsmanship
Every little bit matters, so pay close attention to detail. Think of projects, not jobs. Projects need passion, demand responsibility and, in turn, are uniquely personal and rewarding.

# Above, beyond
Show no respect for the status quo. Strive to excel in all you do; to challenge the standards set and exceed your own.

# Create to inspire
The true measure of success is not in what you create, but in how you inspire. Every project should have a profound impact on its audience, whether it's the local community or the world.

# Win as one
The best work comes when goals are united. Build open, candid and personal relationships with colleagues, clients and partners.
